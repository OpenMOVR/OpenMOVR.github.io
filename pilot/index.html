            <p class="subtitle">We're building something transformative—and we want you to be part of it.</p>
            <p>The Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) is launching a limited-time pilot to co-create MOVR 2.0, our next-generation data platform designed with families at the center. This is your opportunity to directly influence how data is collected, visualized, and used to accelerate research and improve care for individuals living with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD), Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA), or Limb-Girdle Muscular Dystrophy (LGMD).</p>
            <p>With the power of artificial intelligence and your lived experience, we're reimagining what a research platform can be—intuitive, insightful, and deeply connected to the needs of our community.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>You'll receive a link to one of three platforms (Unite Genomics, Citizen Health, or Vibrent Health). You'll create an account, explore how it works, enter some medical information (as much as you're comfortable with), and complete a brief feedback survey. Work at your own pace. Most participants spend about 30-45 minutes on initial setup.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">Which platform will I use?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>After you sign up, we'll send you a link to one of the three platforms. We're balancing participation across all three so we can fairly evaluate each one. Want to try more than one? During sign-up you can indicate interest in exploring multiple platforms and we'll send you all three links.</p>

                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Your data is stored securely on HIPAA-compliant platforms. We follow strict privacy guidelines, and no personally identifying information is shared without your explicit consent. You're always in control—you decide what to share and can remove your data anytime.</p>

                <h3 class="faq-question">What's the difference between platform enrollment and research study consent?</h3>
                <div class="faq-answer">
                    <p>Great question! After you sign up, you'll complete two steps with Jessica's guidance:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Platform enrollment:</strong> Creating your account on the assigned platform (Unite Genomics, Citizen Health, or Vibrent Health)</li>
                        <li><strong>Research study consent:</strong> Agreeing to participate in MDA's research study</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>Both steps are important. Completing the research study consent allows MDA to access aggregated, de-identified insights from your platform experience. This helps us evaluate which platform features work best and make informed decisions about MOVR 2.0's future.</p>
                    <p>If you create a platform account but don't complete the research consent, you can still use the platform independently—but MDA won't be able to include your experience in our evaluation. Don't worry if you miss this step initially; Jessica will send friendly follow-up reminders to ensure you're fully enrolled and your participation counts toward shaping MOVR's future!</p>

                    <p>Initial setup takes about 30-45 minutes. After using the platform, we'll send a brief feedback survey (about 10 minutes). Some participants may be invited to optional focus groups.</p>
