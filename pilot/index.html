            <p class="subtitle">Be among the first to explore new tools designed by families, for families</p>
            <p>MDA is reimagining MOVR—our national platform that helps families manage medical information for neuromuscular diseases—and we need your input. If you're living with DMD, SMA, or LGMD, you know what it takes to keep track of complex care and coordinate with multiple providers.</p>
            <p>By joining this pilot, you'll explore new tools designed to make managing your health information easier and more intuitive. Your feedback will directly shape how MOVR serves the neuromuscular community.</p>

                <p>We're testing three different technology platforms to see which works best for families: Unite Genomics, Citizen Health, and Vibrent Health. After you sign up, we'll send you a link to get started with one of them.</p>
