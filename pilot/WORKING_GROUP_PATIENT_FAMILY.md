## 1. Why We're Here (3 min)

### The Problem
Families managing DMD, SMA, and LGMD deal with:
- Medical records scattered across providers
- No easy way to see the full picture
- Repeating the same information over and over
- Feeling disconnected from research that could help

### What MOVR Has Been
- MDA's registry tracking neuromuscular disease data since 2013
- Over 5,800 participants, 20,000+ encounters
- Valuable for research, but limited tools for families

### What MOVR 2.0 Could Be
- A platform that works FOR you, not just collects FROM you
- Your health data visualized and organized
- Connection between your care journey and research
- Built with your input, not just about you
